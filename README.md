# T.O.M. = Totally Outstanding Man

That's how I would describe myself, if I was egocentric human being. However, I am actually really generous person. This page was made in a dark corner of my room when I had nothing to do. It is something like a playground where I try cool stuff such as the TypeWriting which is shown when you get on the page.

Another useful feature of this page is an information about my knowledge, projects and etc. for possible new job oppurtunities and much more!!!

For now, this page uses:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
